# love
It is a game where you have to go through a series of mazes together with your partner to pass the levels and succeed in love.

## play share learn grow
I think playing is very important for development at all ages. Through the game anyone can share with others, learn from them and that causes growth. Although in all the games we can apply these concepts in those of collaboration, the growth is greater.

## story
BOY and GIRL fell in love a long time ago. But Evil Routine took them apart. Can you reunite them?

## how the game works
![screen shot][screen-shot]
The game will show two boards. The controls on the left are the WASD keys, and those on the right are the ARROW keys. The goal is to reach the exit portal, but to open it, players need the key. The tiles below trigger different actions:
- Blue tiles disappear after one step.
- Orange tiles never disappear.
- Pink tiles, step on one and all will disappear.
